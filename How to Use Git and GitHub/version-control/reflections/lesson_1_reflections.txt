How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

By comparision of two files, I can find the changes.

By analysizing those changes, I can see how the bug introduced.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By using some professional softwares such as Github for Mac.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Manually:
	Pros: I have more control on the whole process.
	Cons: Some accidents may occure. If I did not save it, it will be a problem.
Automatically:
	Pros: Good protection of my work.
	Cons: Some versions are not valuable.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it a must for guranteing codes function well.
