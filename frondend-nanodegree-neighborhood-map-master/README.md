## Neighborhood Map

I developed a single-page application featuring a map of a neighborhood I would like to visit. Then I added additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to places I would like to visit, a search function to easily discover these location and Wikipedia about each location.


Resources used in the creation of the neighborhood map (in addition to the JavaScript Design Patterns and the Intro to AJAX classes):

Google Maps API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial

Google Places library: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places

Wikipedia: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API%3aMain_page#A_simple_example

Knockout.js: http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html

Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/css/

To run the application, download all repository files (clone the repository). 
Then open index.html in your browser.
